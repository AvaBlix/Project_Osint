*/üèÜ Project_Osint: The OSINT Challenge üïµÔ∏è/*

A collegiate challenge designed to introduce students to Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and cybersecurity through a practical, hands-on, simulated scenario.


*/üéØ Goal of the Challenge/*

The primary objective is for participants to utilize publicly available information (OSINT) to piece together the seven (7) distinct fragments of a secret access key.


Successful completion involves:

  Collecting Password Fragments: Students will search various pre-determined public sources (mock profiles, forum posts, etc.) to find the seven unique pieces of information.

  Constructing the Access Key: Combining these seven fragments in the correct order to form the full password.

  Accessing the Secure File: Using the constructed password to unlock the final challenge file: The Reward Vault [Google Drive Link].

  Retrieving the Code: Finding the secret reward code (the "flag") hidden inside the accessed file.

  Submitting the Code: Submitting the code via the official submission link to complete the challenge.

*/üîí The Final Lock: Accessing the Reward File/*

The ultimate goal is to gain access to a specific Google Drive File (Document or Sheet) that contains the final code.


  Target File: Project_Osint_Reward_File.pdf (or similar file type)

  Access Method: The file itself is viewable, but the content within the file is encrypted or password-protected using the seven-part password you must discover.

*/üß© The Password Structure: A Seven-Part Mystery/*

The secret access key is a complex, alphanumeric sequence built from seven distinct fragments that you must locate and assemble. Think of it as a seven-piece jigsaw puzzle scattered across the public internet.


The fragments are hidden in plain sight across mock profiles, forum posts, and college-affiliated public pages. To successfully unlock the reward file, you must find all seven parts and arrange them in their correct sequence.


Hints on What to Look For:

The fragments represent a variety of digital artifacts, including:


  A Challenge Identifier: A key prefix or name, likely associated with a fictional Capture the Flag or challenge event.

  A Connector: A small, functional word or symbol that links two larger pieces, often found in a short, public status or comment.

  A Cryptic Identifier (Alpha-Numeric): A four-character mix of letters and numbers, hinting at data or the nature of the information being sought.

  An Access Prefix: A short sequence of characters and numbers followed by a critical symbol (:), suggesting an access or control mechanism.

  A Subject Keyword: A longer string related to the CyberSecurity field, perhaps used as a tag or a fictional department name.

  A College Identifier: A fragment referencing the institution or the Champion status of a fictional group, including a necessary symbol (@).

  A Concluding Suffix: A final short, positive suffix or tag, bringing the sequence to an end.

Your core challenge is to locate all seven pieces of evidence, verify their content, and determine the precise order they must be concatenated to form the complete password and unlock the file.

  The password is complete with its wordings, The requirement it to find and Arange them.

  eg:- (I_Am_hacking@2025) will be fragmented into (I_Am)(_hack)(ing@2)(025)
